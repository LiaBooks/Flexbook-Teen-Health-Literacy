This material has been donated to the CK-12 Foundation, where it nicely complements and supplements the Life Science Concepts. The program consists of 24 videos describing health literacy. Each video has been augmented here with a series of questions that can be answered either during or after watching the video. Each section has been aligned with associated CK-12 Life Science and Biology Concepts, and has academic vocabulary added and defined where appropriate. The CK-12 concepts can be studied for additional information on these important topics.")
